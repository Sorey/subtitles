1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,149
okay we are ready to tackle validation

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,040
which is pretty fun so if I switch over
to articles controller

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,410
this is where we left off the only
difference

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,440
is that I've added some doc locks to the
various methods this is a good habit to

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,080
get into

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,800
and locally if you do something like
peach be storm they can automate this

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,689
process

8
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,859
alright so let's head down to the store
method

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,680
this is what we need to focus on so if
you remember

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,868
in its current state we could submit
this form

11
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:35,390
and no error would be thrown we try it
and a new role has been entered into the

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,439
database table

13
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,519
and were echoing it out but there's
nothing there

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
this is a very bad thing so instead
we're gonna leverage

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,550
validation to ensure that the sorts of
things never happen

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,558
so let's tackle that now but real quick

17
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,140
let's do a select star from articles and
I'm getting to lead

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,520
from articles where the ID Eagle 7

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,329
just to start from scratch okay let's
get into it

20
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,079
now many show you two different ways to
handle this one

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,519
is through using what we call a former
Qwest class

22
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,759
an object this is really nice for more
complex validation

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,859
but you also have things where it's very
simple

24
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,269
you just wanna make sure that the user
does fill out a fielder to

25
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:22,500
and then you can continue and for those
situations

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,489
we can take advantage perpetrate that
where bill includes by default

27
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,530
so let's start with former quests as you
can imagine

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,829
we have a generator for that so higher
and peach PR dicen

29
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,408
and we scroll up you'll see this section
right here make

30
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,040
request now think these classes as a way
for the user

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
to make some kind of request for your
application

32
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,658
whether it's signing up or upgrading
their subscription

33
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,680
or in this case creating a new article

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,649
so what we try this out make a new
former Qwest

35
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,570
and we could call it create article or
publish article

36
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,398
or schedule whatever sorta terminology
your business uses

37
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,989
in this case a simple credit approach is
fine now a lot of people will

38
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,430
add request to the end as a suffix you
can do that

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,689
you can leave it off it's up to you will
keep it on here though

40
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,150
and that's it so now we will switch back

41
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,260
and if I open up ap HTTP

42
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,560
requests this is where those classes
will be added

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,409
man this looks a little confusing at
first but actually it's very

44
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:34,299
very simple so we have two different
methods here authorize

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,769
in roles the first one is Dez the user
have permission

46
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,980
to perform this kind of request or
action

47
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,500
here's an example what if somebody was
trying to

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,949
edit a comment that they didn't create
well

49
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:52,238
of course we don't want to allow that
John cannot

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,920
added a comment that was created by
chain this

51
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,589
is where we can and that sort of logic
now in our case we don't even really

52
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,530
have a membership system setup

53
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,890
somebody said that a true anyone can
make this request

54
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,158
currently next we have our rules

55
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,189
and this is where we can add our Terms
essentially

56
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,949
for the request for example if we go
back to article slash create

57
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,009
we have a title abadi in a published at

58
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,859
okay well we can reference those exact
names

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,360
title will be required next

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,120
the body will be required as well and
are published at

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,610
will be required as well but maybe
there's

62
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,040
other things we need to do as well for
example imagine you have a sign-up form

63
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,009
and your email field should be required
but it should also be

64
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,628
other specific type it should look like
an email address

65
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:50,280
and then maybe your name is required but
also it needs to be at least

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,150
two characters lock and if you want to
see a full massive list of what you can

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,650
do

68
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,920
go to learn how to calm slash stocks
slash

69
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,158
validation now what we had a couple more

70
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,829
we can either use the pipe here so I
could say required

71
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,950
and it should also be at that date tight
some notice we use a pipe to separate

72
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,579
them

73
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,390
or if you prefer you can use a general
array

74
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,599
either one works let's just stick with
the pipe for now

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,169
next for the title mostly just for fun
will say it needs to happen minimum

76
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:21,649
length

77
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,349
up three characters

78
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,200
how about that well I can say men

79
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,709
Colin and then the minimum value think
this has our argument

80
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:34,879
sonar case it should be at least 3
characters so we can represent it like

81
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,449
that

82
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,829
all rights and now we set up our
authorization

83
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,599
we've set up our validation rules let's
switch back to our controller

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,129
and now all we're gonna do is ty painted
right here

85
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,120
create article request and we'll call it

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,220
request okay so we can leave it like
this

87
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,390
or we can import the class at the top in
clean things up just a little bit

88
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,089
and then we will update our talk lock
cool

89
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:05,810
so now here's a very important concept
to understand

90
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,399
when we type hence this former Qwest
behind-the-scenes

91
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,469
lagerfeld's going to pick up on the fact
that we are dealing with validation here

92
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,790
and it will automatically trigger the
validation

93
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,810
before this method actually gets
executed that's really important to

94
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,610
understand

95
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,750
so in translation what that means

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,069
is the body this method one never fire

97
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,240
we won't ever create an article unless

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,910
our validation past now what happens if
it failed

99
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,490
well for example at the user doesn't
enter anything in the title

100
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,500
the validation fails this method never
gets fired

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,120
and instead we actually redirect to the
previous page

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,459
so that the user can try again okay so
before we tried this on the browser

103
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,620
let's go to the cycle once together the
user

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,639
comes to the create page: in the fill
out the various fields in the form

105
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,620
now when the form cements we prepare

106
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,009
to trigger this method however lagerfeld
picks up on the fact that we've tight

107
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,209
end to this object

108
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,299
and it's going to do its best to give us
that object

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,139
however in the process it will detect
that this object can be validated

110
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,500
so it triggers that validation
automatically for you

111
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,139
if validation passes it gives us a
request object

112
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,228
can we create the article however if
validation passes

113
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:30,349
once again this method never triggers

114
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,390
and we instead redirect to the previous
route

115
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,248
so that the user can correct them

116
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:39,109
stake from the form so now what I want
you to notice

117
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,308
is that with implemented validation
without adding

118
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:46,279
a single line to this method body so I
can remove that

119
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,298
next we are receiving the request

120
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:53,328
so we no longer need to use the facade I
can just save request

121
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,629
all and that would be equivalent which
means at the top

122
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,449
we can remove that import right there
okay

123
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,989
very clean so why don't we try this out
in the browser

124
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,149
and see if it works

125
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,289
we will they said article sash creates
in this time

126
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,290
we will enter thanks so answer entire

127
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,390
and the current eight is fine and the
article

128
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,769
and everything worked so no issues there
but this time

129
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:24,479
we're gonna try to submit the form
without feeling something and

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
let's leave the body plank okay one now

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,660
I add article and take a look

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,640
we didn't get redirected back to that
main page which is redirected

133
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,729
back to this form because the validation
failed

134
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,870
so that's what I mean when I say is all
sort of happens

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,300
automatically which is cool but we do
have one problem

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,500
if the user makes a mistake well we
didn't notify them what went wrong

137
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,250
so they really have no clue and as you
can imagine for a big form

138
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,720
this is a problem we need to get them
some feedback

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,700
so what we fix that we can do that by
returning

140
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,689
to our view in 10 we display any
validation errors

141
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,639
right below the form now here's the next
important thing for you to understand

142
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,219
your views were always have access to
and errors

143
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,150
variable so to demonstrate that if we
would have our top

144
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,919
errors list to see what would happen so
we visit the page

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,000
and right now you can see it's an ever
back we didn't have to create that

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,689
variable

147
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,189
or pass it to the view it was
automatically done Byler hell

148
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,229
right now its empty because we have no
validation errors

149
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,050
but if we do run s now take a look

150
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,149
we ran the validation it failed it
redirected back

151
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,769
it populated the airbag and now you can
see we have

152
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,169
to areas here so here's what we can do

153
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:54,309
we could say if week have any errors

154
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,489
this is nothing more than a helper
method but let us know

155
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,810
if we have any errors so if we do and we
landed at the bottom

156
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,309
then we want to display them one that we
use some bootstrap classes

157
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,929
alert an alert danger now

158
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,149
I can say if we have any errors then
fort

159
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,129
each error as error then

160
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:20,460
display ed with analysts item like so
and then finally

161
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,690
and for each and we're done create the
EC

162
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,450
so let's try this one more time we had
no errors

163
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,180
so we display nothing but next we try to
submit the form

164
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,649
and we do have a risk so you see them
listed here

165
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,569
and it looks like our CSS it a little
bit of but you get the basic idea

166
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,950
the important thing is that the user has
some feedback now

167
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,530
so maybe we fill out the title but we
leave the body plank

168
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,259
much at article now that works and
notice how the messages are dynamic

169
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,389
so let's say eight we fill up the body
we fill out a title

170
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,889
so we handled the required validation
rule but we don't have enough characters

171
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,439
remember we set a minimum length on now
and we run it

172
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,820
it will still fail in the message will
be updated accordingly

173
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,330
so once again let's properly form and

174
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,540
this and we'll publish it today and
after we add the article

175
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,329
everything worked so validation decision
that harden your cell

176
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,460
but let me show you one last thing to
finish up the lesson

177
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,780
we talked about former quests which are
pretty cool

178
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,559
they offer a nice clean dedicated place
to put this stuff

179
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,729
however if you don't wanna bother
creating a class

180
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,139
like I told you we can also call the
Validate method

181
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,470
directly on the controller let me show
you what this looks like

182
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,279
if we take a look at the parent class
and notice that we

183
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,779
import this straight called validates
request and specifically we have the

184
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,809
Validate method

185
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:50,699
where you give it your request you get
your rules and it was essentially

186
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,370
perform

187
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,070
in the exact same way so let's try this
out

188
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,340
this time we come back here and now

189
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,370
when I can use create article request
will just use where hells general

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,379
request so let me import that at the top

191
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,580
eliminate HTTP request

192
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,770
we'll update our doc block and now

193
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,470
we don't need a former Qwest we can just
call validate directly on the controller

194
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,250
we give it the request this will give us
the information

195
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,339
at the user typed into the form and then
we pass our validation rules

196
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,230
chest like we did before

197
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,959
right here so let's keep it very simple

198
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,409
title is required and body

199
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,019
is required

200
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,278
so like I said for basic stuff this is a
nice way to go

201
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,688
it's quick and fast alright so now let's
try this one out together

202
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:47,259
we will create a new article I'm gonna
leave this plank

203
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:50,528
in we should get the exact same thing
and we do

204
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,259
so it's up to you to decide when each
one is important

205
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,389
if you want you could always use upon
request and never call that validate met

206
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,418
another controller

207
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:03,369
some people would say it's not the
controller's job to handle that election

208
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,089
really once again it just depends upon
context

209
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,499
what's cool though is you can make up
your own mind on this

210
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,970
so what we're going to do in this case
since we already created eighty create

211
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,869
former Qwest

212
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:19,829
min and do a few steps and bring it back
to what we had before

213
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:23,969
okay so that looks good good job in the
next video

214
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,129
let's return to our views and talk a
little bit about partials

215
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,889
and how we can clean and dry up our code
